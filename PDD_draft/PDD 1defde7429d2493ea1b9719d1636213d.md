# PDD

# Introduction

The goal of this project is to take an audio signal and parse out the magnitude of its fundamental frequencies.

Possible use cases are for machine ear training for music (it can tell if an interval played is a perfect fourth or major third). This could also be used for noise removal, since frequencies that are typically not spoken at can be removed. Another possible use is to detect for young people spray which are speakers that play sounds at a certain high pitch so that only young people can get annoyed by them.

See: [Hardware Requirements](asda) and [Perliminary Design document](http://google.com)

Project was done using arduino ide and Tiny FPGA BX driver suite, and icarus-verilog.

## Expectations

My expections coming into this course was that everything would very rigorous, testing as you go and understanding the first principles behind every peice of software and hardware. I expected to learn a lot about instruments and harware components (such as transisters, capacitors and ICs) but not as much about software tools and libraries.

I think the reasons for this was because when I think about low level proggraming I generally think that everything would self contained. When I proggramed in C, everything single function and header file was written by me. Similarly, in the TEJ3M course all of the code that we used was copy-pasted instead of imported. Moreover, every circuit was built out of relatively simple components that could be analyzed using a combination of boolean algebra and linear circuit analysis.

## What I learned

For better or for worse, I decided to do signals analysis for my project. I quickly realized that I would not be able to make a working circuit by hand to do a fourier transform. For this reason, I decided to use an FPGA so that I would still be able to think about it on a hardware level rather than a software one. 

I ended up using quite a bit of elementary circuit components (capacitors, resistors, jumpers) . I also learned about compound components such as the [CD4050 hex buffer IC](https://components101.com/ics/cd4050-hex-buffer-non-inverter-ic-datasheet-pinout-features#:~:text=CD4050%20IC%20is%20a%20hex,CMOS%20to%20DTL%2F%20TTL%20converters.) and the op amps.

In conclusion, I learned: how to build circuits on bread broads; system and description verilog; arduino proggraming; how to use an oscilliscope.

## Enjoy and not Enjoy

The part I enjoyed the most was building circuits, soldering and learning verilog. I liked building circuits and soldering because it was very relaxing and self contained. I could just look at the bread board diagram and schematic and then connected the wires accordingly. Learning verilog was fun because it was nice change of pace in comparison to normal proggraming. Additionally, it felt like any circuit I could imagine could be implemented in such a powerful description languages.

What I did not enjoy was all of the time I hand to spend getting SPI protocol to work. The goal of this project was to use FPGA’s to parrallelize fourier transforms not to order regulators off of amazon. Spending half of my time worrying about a 5V to 3.3V voltage conversion was incredibly annoying. 

Another thing I didn’t enjoy was the extremely complicated and bug ridden process of installing the tiny BX tool chain. Almost every command in the instruction threw some sort of error and would require me to search of all over the internet just to find a suitable solution. Additionally, when I finally got the voltage conversion to work, the drivers decided to completely stop working all together. Overall I found the toolchain poorly documented and confusing.

## Product Development

The research phase went quite well. Other then the toolchain complications, learning the theory behind FFT’s, Verilog and SPI went very smoothly. The online resources were very comprehensive on the matters mentioned above (and more importantly **easy to find**).

What didn’t go well is the voltage conversion

### Microphone circuit

In order to get an audio signal, I had to make a microphone circuit. This is where I did most of my hands on circuit building and testing. I learned how use OP-amps and that there is a difference between a Ceramic and Electrolytic capacitor. 

### SPI protocol

Although I did not get the FPGA portion of the project to work, in order to communicate between the FPGA and arduino I had to setup a SPI connection between them. However, the FPGA is 3.3V whereas the arduino outputs 5V. I would somehow have to convert the arduino SPI port outputs from 5V into 3.3V. 

I used the oscilliscope to test the clarity and voltage level of the converted signals.

My first approach was using the [CD4050 hex buffer IC](https://components101.com/ics/cd4050-hex-buffer-non-inverter-ic-datasheet-pinout-features#:~:text=CD4050%20IC%20is%20a%20hex,CMOS%20to%20DTL%2F%20TTL%20converters.). This component basically takes an target voltage as input. All signals passing through the signal ports are then converted to the target volatage. The problem with this methode was that the arduino’d 3.3V output port. was not reliable. To remedy this, I tried to use a voltage divider to create my own 3.3V power source. However, because the voltage divider used resisters, this resulted in the signal becoming incredibly distorted.

Finally, I decided to just convert the [entire arduino uno to 3.3V](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-tips-tricks-and-techniques/3-3v-conversion). To do so, I had to learn how to solder. I basically replaced the regulator with 3.3V regulator and then added a power diode.

### Verilog

Verilog is the hardware description language used to program FPGAs. Verilog is not a procedural proggraming language, but rather it simply described which connection should be made within the FPGA, which the driver then converts into actual FPGA “circuitry”. Verilog’s principal mechanism for abstraction are called “modules” which behave like circuit components.

To test the verilog code you have to use system verilog, which is basically verilog that runs procedurally (almost identical in architecture to C). The version of system verilog I used was icarus-verilog.

Morever, it is often times useful to see the signal output when testing a verilog module. To do so I used [gtk-wave](https://www.notion.so/laskjdlkajs-9247380119da49c6ae986948ac1fd037) and the vscode wavetrace-extension.

## Advice for next time

I think that the process definitely would have gone smoother had I choosen a FPGA with an internal SPI debug port. This would have saved most of the time that I spend on the Voltage conversion.

## Industry Predictions

I think this course has prepared me for the soft-skills aspect of working as an engineer. Writing journals and design documents was certainly not something I ever imagined being a part of the engineering process. However, I now realise that it helps both to solidify confidence in ones and communicate the importance of your project to others.

I think the main difference between the FPGA development I did and that of industry is the amount of mentorship and documentation. I think that industry would probably have much better documenation and support services. Moreover, they would have specialized probs and measurement devices for testing the FPGA at the hardware level rather than just in the simulator. I think that these two factors would make FPGA development much less painful and more rigorous in industry.
